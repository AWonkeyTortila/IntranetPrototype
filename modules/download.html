        <p>I want to make this sort of like the Windows Store back in the Windows Vista era. Here you can download little web modules or even apps from the internet securely, and be able to use them.</p>
        <p>The only issue with this is that you'll have to manually link it in the code. It's not hard, but im just concerned that no one will want to be able to do it. But then again, if you're using this, you're probably a nerd like me lmao.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Or maybe I should let people slap on pages when they submit code? This would be better, but would take up more space. All though, im pretty sure thumgdrives are kinda dirt cheap now. Got three 32Gb sticks for like ten bucks lmao.</p>
        <p>Perhaps let this be the page where you can download EXEs and stuff..? I dunno, we'll have to see about it. But I definently want a store of sorts to download things. I think that'll be a cool idea.</p>

        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Intranet!</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>What is the intranet?</b> The Intranet is basically the interney but downloaded localy on your hard disk, also mixed with the idea of being both a way to browse the internet on legacy machines and, also being able to experience he old net. So kinda of a mess.</p>
        <p><b>What web pages should I visit?</b> You should visit the few web pages that there are. Or perhpas later on if theres image boards for niche communities, find one you like!</p>
        <p><b>What if there's nothing I like?</b> Then by all means, create your own little corner on the Intranet! We here (well, me for now) fully support free speech, so feel free to express yourself, and let your creativity flurish!</p>
